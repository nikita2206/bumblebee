What is this?
-------------

Bumblebee was a name of one of the main characters from Transformers movie. Bumblebee is a library that helps you
to transform data from one structure to another, be it an object-to-array mapping, array-to-object mapping, or even
array-to-array mapping from one structure to another.

Where can this be useful?
-------------------------

Data transformation is one of the main things that happen in systems of different complexity. It is happening
when you are mapping your data-objects to a representation that is compatible with your view layer, it is also happening
when you are mapping database results on objects or user input on your data-objects.
